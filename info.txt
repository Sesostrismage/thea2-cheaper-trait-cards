  <TAG>Gameplay</TAG>This mod sets the unlock cost and use cost of all trait cards at game start to 1, so that you can build a stronger starting party.
  
  This mod changes DATABASE_TRAIT_CARDS.xml and will not work with other mods that also modify this file. I've tried to only include the UseCost entries, but then the database won't load. :-(</ModInfo>
